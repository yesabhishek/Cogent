    Whichever industry you work in, or whatever your interests, you will almost
    certainly have come across a story about how ‚Äúdata‚Äù is changing the face of
    our world. It might be part of a study helping to cure a disease, boost a
    company‚Äôs revenue, make a building more efficient or be responsible for
    those targeted ads you keep seeing. In general, data is simply another word
    for information. But in computing and business (most of what you read about
    in the news when it comes to data ‚Äì especially if it‚Äôs about Big Data), data
    refers to information that is machine-readable as opposed to human-readable.

    Today, gathering data to help you better understand your customers and
    business is relatively easy. In fact, it‚Äôs become so easy there‚Äôs the danger
    of having too much data to deal with. In a recent article, data and
    analytics guru Bernard Marr said: ‚ÄúWhile the average small business has less
    self-generated data than big players. . .this doesn‚Äôt mean big data is off
    limits. In fact, in many ways, big data is more suited to small businesses,
    because they‚Äôre generally more agile and able to act more quickly on
    data-driven insights.‚Äù A Forbes article discussing a survey from Deloitte,
    notes that ‚Äú49 percent of respondents said analytics helps them make better
    decisions, 16 percent say that it better enables key strategic initiatives,
    and 10 percent say it helps them improve relationships with both customers
    and business partners.‚Äù But to take full advantage of data and analytics,
    you need to know how to get the most value from your data.

    Data analysis is defined as a process of cleaning, transforming, and
    modeling data to discover useful information for business decision-making.
    The purpose of Data Analysis is to extract useful information from data and
    taking the decision based upon the data analysis. Whenever we take any
    decision in our day-to-day life is by thinking about what happened last time
    or what will happen by choosing that particular decision. This is nothing
    but analyzing our past or future and making decisions based on it. For that,
    we gather memories of our past or dreams of our future. So that is nothing
    but data analysis. Now same thing analyst does for business purposes, is
    called Data Analysis.
